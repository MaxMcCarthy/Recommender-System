# Recommendation System:

If the user is interested in an event type, all events of that type are returned to them 

Created sets for each category that is an option in the survey and then created a function for returning events that are part of the union of the selected categories.

## Possible future improvements:

Modify recommender system to use data(collected from the user) to provide more accurate and useful recommendations based on the events the user likes or dislikes once it is recommended to them.
If more than one category is chosen by user, sort the results from most chosen categories to the events that only have one of the chosen categories.
